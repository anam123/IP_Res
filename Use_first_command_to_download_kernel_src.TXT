  - Download Kernel src
     $ git clone -b android-msm-dory-3.10-lollipop-wear-release https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm
     
  - Run following scripts to build kernel
     a) cd kernel folder
     b) download and register tool chain
        When you compile the kernel source code, you have to add google original prebuilt source(toolchain) into the android directory.
        Downloading a prebuilt gcc
        Ensure that the prebuilt toolchain is in your path.
        $ export PATH=$(pwd)/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.6/bin:$PATH
         or
        $ export PATH=$(pwd)/prebuilts/gcc/darwin-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.6/bin:$PATH
        On a linux host, if you don't have an Android source tree, you can download the prebuilt toolchain from:
        $ git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.6
        
     c) configure kernel config
        $ make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi- ARCH=arm dory_defconfig   
        
     d) build kernel
        $ make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi- ARCH=arm
        
  - After build, you can find the build image(zImage) at arch/arm/boot/zImage-dtb
